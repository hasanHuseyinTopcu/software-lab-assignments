AIM
In this experiment we will aim to learn and practice dynamic arrays. You are expected to implement a
program to compute some statistics, mean and standart deviation. To compute these statistics, we
have an interesting problem about ground water.

running command = ./a.out 10 100
first parameter is matrix size
second parameter is independent experiment number

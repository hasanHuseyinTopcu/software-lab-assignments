In this experiment you are supposed to develop a console based hypothetic Twitter application.
Your homework will be implemented as a console application. Moreover, it will read an input file
named “input.txt” and will output the results at both screen and the file “out.txt” The input file will
be provided for you just after your class hour.
The program logic and the commands lying in the input file is given below. The parameters of each
line are delimited by blank space. Therefore long strings (e.g. sentences) were filled with
underscore ‘_’ character. The italic names are unique in system wide. In other words, the values of
these parameters are completely unique.
